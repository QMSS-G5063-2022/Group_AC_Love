# Group_AC_Love

**Abstract**: 
Our group would like to use two datasets to explore Netflix’s coverage of movies and TV shows. More specifically, this project containing two parts: productions’ general trends and contents’ text analysis. In the first part, we strive to find how productions’ characteristics change over time as well as the platform coverage on international contents. In the second part, we analyze key characteristics that contribute to being a “high rated” show (including both TV series and Movies) on Netflix. Our analysis can give a general idea of the development of film and television programs and public’s preference on contents.



**Kaggle Dataset**: 
The first part of the analysis we use:
