# Group_AC_Love

**Abstract**: 
Our group would like to explore what influences love at first sight, using dataset from Kaggle Speed Dating Experiment. Through this dataset, we will be able to explore different questions such as What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners? Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market? Within this dataset, there are a lot of aspects we like to explore, such as geographical location, career, individual background, etc. We are thinking of visualizing the geospatial data, word cloud, sentiment analysis, etc.

On top of this dataset, we could also like to include data from Youtube platform, using API to get hashtags. Looking at what are the hashtags that are used together while implementing time/date into the dataset to look at how has the dating culture changed over the past decades.  


**Kaggle Dataset**: https://data.world/annavmontoya/speed-dating-experiment 
-	The data is from speed dating events of 550 people from 2002-2004. 
-	During the experimental data events, each participant was asked to fill out a survey asking to rate how much they value the six attributes (Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests) from a partner.  
-	Each participant would have a four minute “first date” with every other participant of the opposite sex. After the “first date”, each participant must decide if they would like to have a second date and to rate the counterpart on their performance in the six attributes (Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests)

**Youtube Data**
-	We will also use Youtube API to extract content that contains hashtag such as “speed dating”“love”, “dating”. 
-	We will compare if the data from speed dating and the data from Youtube shows similar or different trends of people’s attitude towards speed dating 
-	We could also look at contents from different age groups and geographic groups to create visualizations.
